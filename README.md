# Zim against the universe

## What is Zim against the universe?

Zim is trying finally conquer not only earth but the universe... reason why u know, worlds are trying to fight back. Problem is that the threat tracking device was developed by Zim fueld by passion, gir took care of graphics and i lended some help with the logic, reason why the system is precise on destruction but won't tell you where the threats are. Your mission is to guess based on knowing the story line, where the attacking devices are located, take them down, and out of existance!

I choose to make this game, as i find for my thought process it's hard to have that visual/logical mix while developing, reason why i branched out of my initial proposal into something i have a clearer idea of where this 2 worlds mix.

Plus, Zim is HxCx!

## Technical Discussion

I'll be using a mix HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
